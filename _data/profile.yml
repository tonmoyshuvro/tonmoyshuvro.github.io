    A passionate Computer Science student <strong>(and former Lecturer)</strong> with research interests spanning 
    <em>Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), 
    Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Computer Vision, Digital Image Processing, and Intelligent Systems</em>. 
    Driven by the goal of applying advanced technologies to create meaningful impact, I am particularly interested in solving real-world challenges across diverse fields, including 
    <strong>medicine, social innovation, biological research, and physics</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Engineering at Varendra University, securing 
    <strong>1<sup>st</sup> position</strong> with an exemplary CGPA of 3.98/4.00. 
    Following my graduation, I served as a <strong>Lecturer</strong> at my university, teaching core Computer Science courses such as 
    <em>Artificial Intelligence Lab</em>, <em>Structured Programming Language</em>, <em>Software Engineering</em>, 
    <em>Computer Graphics</em>, and <em>Operating Systems and Systems Programming</em>.
