  <p>
    I am a passionate Computer Science student <strong>(and former Lecturer)</strong> with research interests spanning 
    <em>Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), 
    Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and Computer Vision.</em> 
    I am particularly interested in contributing real-world challenges across diverse fields, including 
    <strong>social innovation, environmental and biological research, physics <em> (specifically I am very drawn to Astrophysics)</em>, chemistry or, similar domains </strong> that have meaningful impact on humankind and the society.
  </p>
  <p>
    I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Engineering at Varendra University, securing 
    <strong>1<sup>st</sup> position</strong> with an exemplary <strong>CGPA of 3.98/4.00</strong>. 
    Following my graduation, I served as a <strong>Lecturer</strong> at my university, teaching core Computer Science courses such as 
    <em>Artificial Intelligence Lab</em>, <em>Structured Programming Language</em>, <em>Software Engineering</em>, 
    <em>Computer Graphics</em>, and <em>Operating Systems and Systems Programming</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently, I am working as a <strong>Senior Visualizer</strong> at the Ed-Tech company <a href="https://www.programming-hero.com" target="_blank">Programming Hero</a>, where I blend visual storytelling 
    with functional design to make programming education more accessible and engaging. 
    This rare combination of technical expertise and creative visualization empowers me to approach research and design with both analytical precision and aesthetic insight.
  </p>

  <p>
  My current research is centered around contextual analysis in NLP using Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract meaningful insights from vast textual corpora. 
  I have actively worked on integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques and vector search methods to enhance the retrieval and semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs, 
  particularly for large-scale knowledge bases and specialized domains such as software engineering, social media analysis (tweets), and review analysis.

    <em> With a strong foundation in both <strong>scientific research</strong> and <strong>creative design</strong>, 
    I bring a <em>rare combination</em> of analytical depth and aesthetic intuition, 
    ensuring that the systems I design are not only intelligent and scalable but also 
    intuitive, human-centered, and capable of driving real-world impact. </em>
