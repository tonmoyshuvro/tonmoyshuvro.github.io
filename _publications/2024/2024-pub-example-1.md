  Utilized the Galaxy10 DECaLS dataset to classify galaxy morphologies into ten distinct categories. Implemented comprehensive data preprocessing techniques, including image composition, cropping, and normalization, to optimize input data for training. Fine-tuned the pre-trained ViT (vit-base-patch16-224) model using tailored image transformations and custom training loops. Evaluated the modelâ€™s performance using accuracy metrics to assess the effectiveness and reliability of the galaxy classification pipeline.
