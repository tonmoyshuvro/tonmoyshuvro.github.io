  Utilized the DevGPT dataset and custom chat prompts to optimize semantic retrieval in the software engineering domain. Conducted experiments with the Gemma-7B-it model to explore advanced techniques for semantic retrieval and content summarization. Analyzed various prompt template strategies to improve retrieval quality and identified the most commonly queried topics by software engineers when interacting with ChatGPT. Additionally, employed the BART-large-MNLI model to perform zero-shot classification, enabling the extraction of the top 40 most frequent topics from developer queries.
