  This project analyzes Elon Musk's tweets from June 4, 2010, to March 23, 2025, to uncover trends, topics, and insights using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, is processed with Python, leveraging libraries like BERTopic, Transformers, and NLTK to perform topic modeling, text cleaning, and visualization.
